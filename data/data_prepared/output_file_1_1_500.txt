Hou2Max Tegmark1,4 1Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2California Institute of Technology 4The NSF Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov- Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes (“neurons”), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges (“weights”). KANs have no linear weights at all – every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and em- pirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two ex- amples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful “collaborators” helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today’s deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.

Under review.arXiv:2404.19756v1 [cs.LG] 30 Apr 20241 Introduction Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [1, 2, 3], also known as fully-connected feedforward neural net- works, are foundational building blocks of today’s deep learning models. The importance of MLPs can never be overstated, since they are the default models in machine learning for approximating nonlinear functions, due to their expressive power guaranteed by the universal approximation theo- rem [3]. However, are MLPs the best nonlinear regressors we can build? Despite the prevalent use of MLPs, they have significant drawbacks. In transformers [4] for example, MLPs consume almost all non-embedding parameters and are typically less interpretable (relative to attention layers) without post-analysis tools [5]. We propose a promising alternative to MLPs, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Whereas MLPs are inspired by the universal approximation theorem, KANs are inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem [6, 7]. Like MLPs, KANs have fully-connected struc- tures. However, while MLPs place fixed activation functions on nodes (“neurons”), KANs place learnable activation functions on edges (“weights”), as illustrated in Figure 0.1. As a result, KANs have no linear weight matrices at all: instead, each weight parameter is replaced by a learnable 1D function parametrized as a spline. KANs’ nodes simply sum incoming signals without applying any non-linearities. One might worry that KANs are hopelessly expensive, since each MLP’s weight parameter becomes KAN’s spline function. Fortunately, KANs usually allow much smaller compu- tation graphs than MLPs. For example, we show that for PDE solving, a 2-Layer width-10 KAN is100 times more accurate than a 4-Layer width-100 MLP ( 10−7vs10−5MSE)
