[{"question": "What are the main mathematical concepts covered in this content?", "answer": "The main mathematical concepts covered in this content are neural networks (KANs and MLPs), partial differential equations (PDEs), continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, interpretable neural networks, and unsupervised learning."}, {"question": "What are the key equations used in this content?", "answer": "The key equations used in this content are the PDE: uxx + uyy = f(x, y), the loss function: loss_pde = \u03b1 * loss_i + loss_b, and the unsupervised learning equation: f(x1,..., xd) \u2248 0."}, {"question": "What problem-solving strategies are used in this content?", "answer": "The problem-solving strategies used in this content are auto-discovered KAN shapes, pruning KANs to achieve reasonable loss, using KANs to solve PDEs, using KANs to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and using KANs for unsupervised learning."}, {"question": "What are some applications of the concepts and equations covered in this content?", "answer": "Some applications of the concepts and equations covered in this content are solving PDEs (e.g., Poisson equation), continual learning (e.g., avoiding catastrophic forgetting), interpretable neural networks (e.g., revealing compositional structures), and unsupervised learning."}, {"question": "How do KANs differ from MLPs in terms of their ability to avoid catastrophic forgetting?", "answer": "KANs have local plasticity and can avoid catastrophic forgetting by leveraging the locality of splines, whereas MLPs usually use global activations, which is probably the reason for catastrophic forgetting."}]
