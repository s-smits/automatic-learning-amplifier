[{"question": "What is the main idea behind the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem?", "answer": "The Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem is a representation of a function as a composition of smooth functions, which can be used to approximate complex functions."}, {"question": "What is the phenomenon known as neural scaling laws?", "answer": "Neural scaling laws are the phenomenon where test loss decreases with more model parameters, i.e., \u2113\u221dN\u2212\u03b1, where \u2113 is test RMSE, N is the number of parameters, and \u03b1 is the scaling exponent."}, {"question": "How can neural networks be made more accurate?", "answer": "Neural networks can be made more accurate by grid extension (fine-graining spline grids) and sparsification (use of regularization and pruning) to simplify the network and make it more interpretable."}, {"question": "What is the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the context of neural networks?", "answer": "The curse of dimensionality (COD) is a phenomenon where the approximation error of a neural network increases with the number of parameters, making it difficult to train and generalize well."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the number of parameters and the test loss in neural networks?", "answer": "The test loss in neural networks decreases with the number of parameters, following the scaling laws \u03b1 = (k+1)/d, where k is the piecewise polynomial order of the splines and d is the intrinsic dimensionality of the input manifold."}]
