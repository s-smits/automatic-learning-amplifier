While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes (“neurons”), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges (“weights”). KANs have no linear weights at all – every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and em- pirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two ex- amples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful “collaborators” helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today’s deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.

Under review.arXiv:2404.19756v1 [cs.LG] 30 Apr 20241 Introduction Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [1, 2, 3], also known as fully-connected feedforward neural net- works, are foundational building blocks of today’s deep learning models. The importance of MLPs can never be overstated, since they are the default models in machine learning for approximating nonlinear functions, due to their expressive power guaranteed by the universal approximation theo- rem [3]. However, are MLPs the best nonlinear regressors we can build? Despite the prevalent use of MLPs, they have significant drawbacks. In transformers [4] for example, MLPs consume almost all non-embedding parameters and are typically less interpretable (relative to attention layers) without post-analysis tools [5]. We propose a promising alternative to MLPs, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Whereas MLPs are inspired by the universal approximation theorem, KANs are inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem [6, 7]. Like MLPs, KANs have fully-connected struc- tures. However, while MLPs place fixed activation functions on nodes (“neurons”), KANs place learnable activation functions on edges (“weights”), as illustrated in Figure 0.1. As a result, KANs have no linear weight matrices at all: instead, each weight parameter is replaced by a learnable 1D function parametrized as a spline. KANs’ nodes simply sum incoming signals without applying any non-linearities. One might worry that KANs are hopelessly expensive, since each MLP’s weight parameter becomes KAN’s spline function. Fortunately, KANs usually allow much smaller compu- tation graphs than MLPs. For example, we show that for PDE solving, a 2-Layer width-10 KAN is100 times more accurate than a 4-Layer width-100 MLP ( 10−7vs10−5MSE)\n', 'and 100 times more parameter efficient (102vs104parameters). Unsurprisingly, the possibility of using Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to build neural networks has been studied [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. However, most work has stuck with the origi- nal depth-2 width-( 2n+ 1) representation, and did not have the chance to leverage more modern techniques (e.g., back propagation) to train the networks. Our contribution lies in generalizing the original Kolmogorov-Arnold representation to arbitrary widths and depths, revitalizing and con- textualizing it in today’s deep learning world, as well as using extensive empirical experiments to highlight its potential role as a foundation model for AI + Science due to its accuracy and inter- Despite their elegant mathematical interpretation, KANs are nothing more than combinations of splines and MLPs, leveraging their respective strengths and avoiding their respective weaknesses. Splines are accurate for low-dimensional functions, easy to adjust locally, and able to switch between different resolutions. However, splines have a serious curse of dimensionality (COD) problem, because of their inability to exploit compositional structures. MLPs, On the other hand, suffer less from COD thanks to their feature learning, but are less accurate than splines in low dimensions, because of their inability to optimize univariate functions. To learn a function accurately, a model should not only learn the compositional structure ( external degrees of freedom), but should also approximate well the univariate functions ( internal degrees of freedom). KANs are such models since they have MLPs on the outside and splines on the inside. As a result, KANs can not only learn features (thanks to their external similarity to MLPs), but can also optimize these learned features to great accuracy (thanks to their internal similarity to splines). For example, given a high dimensional f(x1,···, xN) = exp i=1sin2(xi)! 2Figure 2.1: Our proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks are in honor of two great late mathematicians, Andrey Kolmogorov and Vladimir Arnold. KANs are mathematically sound, accurate and interpretable. splines would fail for large Ndue to COD; MLPs can potentially learn the the generalized additive structure, but they are very inefficient for approximating the exponential and sine functions with say, ReLU activations. In contrast, KANs can learn both the compositional structure and the univariate functions quite well, hence outperforming MLPs by a large margin (see Figure 3.1). Throughout this paper, we will use extensive numerical experiments to show that KANs can lead to remarkable accuracy and interpretability improvement over MLPs. The organization of the paper is illustrated in Figure 2.1. In Section 2, we introduce the KAN architecture and its mathematical foundation, introduce network simplification techniques to make KANs interpretable, and introduce a grid extension technique to make KANs increasingly more accurate. In Section 3, we show that KANs are more accurate than MLPs for data fitting and PDE solving: KANs can beat the curse of dimensionality when there is a compositional structure in data, achieving much better scaling laws than MLPs. In Section 4, we show that KANs are interpretable and can be used for scientific discov- eries. We use\n']
